_Congratulations!_🎉🎉🎉

You finished the course. You can now make a basic JSON server using Express and NodeJS! You're kind of like a wizard! 🧙 But you have only scratched the surface.

## Learn More Express

The best place to see what's possible with Express is on its [official website](https://expressjs.com/).

If you want to...

- **Organize the calls to Express** learn more about [middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)
- **Build a web backend** instead of the JSON example here, [use a template engine](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-template-engines.html)
- **Store data** from your users, you'll need a [database](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html)

Of course, Express is only one way to use Node...

## Learn More Node

To see the many other applications for Node, visit its [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).

If you want to...

- **Make a basic Node server** to see the difference from Express, see Node's [hello world](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/)
- **Learn some fundamentals** of Node, you can [dig into debugging](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/)
- **Extend Node's functionality**, look into [modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html)

There are also [many Node examples on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/nodejs) to learn from!
